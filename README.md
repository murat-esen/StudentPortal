Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure the following prerequisites are installed on your machine:

.NET SDK (version X.X or higher)
MySQL (or any compatible SQL database)
A code editor (such as Visual Studio or VSCode)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Kodu kopyala
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Kodu kopyala
$ cd your-project-folder
Install dependencies: Restore the required .NET packages by running the following command:

bash
Kodu kopyala
$ dotnet restore
Configure the database: Ensure that MySQL is installed and running on your machine. Create a new database and update the connection string in appsettings.json to match your MySQL credentials.

Example:

json
Kodu kopyala
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=your_database_name;User=root;Password=your_password;"
}
Database Migrations
To apply database migrations and create the necessary tables, run the following command:

bash
Kodu kopyala
$ dotnet ef database update
Running the Project
After setting up the database and installing the dependencies, you can run the project by using the following command:

bash
Kodu kopyala
$ dotnet run
By default, the application will be accessible at https://localhost:5001 (or http://localhost:5000).

API Documentation
The project includes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on the database. You can use tools like Postman to interact with the APIs. Documentation for each endpoint can be found at /swagger when the application is running.

MySQL Integration
This project uses MySQL for data persistence. Entity Framework Core is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the MySQL database. CRUD operations for entities such as "Student" are handled through services and repositories, ensuring a clean and modular architecture.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project for your backend needs! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
Happy coding!
